# blehjo-hw-02

This application is a rough draft of my portfolio.

The assignment tested my knowledge of css, html semantics, and my patience.

Quite challenging, but thanks to the teacher, tas, and my classmates, I was able to complete it to the best of my ability.

I am going to use it as the foundation for all of my work this semester.

In this application there is an index.html, reset.css, style.css, and script.js.
