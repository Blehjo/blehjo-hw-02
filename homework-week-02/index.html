            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Bleh Seton, pronounced like "blay seaton," and I am working on becoming a software engineer.  My family is from west Africa, Guinea and Liberia.  I studied finance at the University of Illinois at Chicago and spent half my academic career in Germany.  Currently, I am a research navigator at NORC located in Chicago, Illinois.  When I am not at work you can catch me playing video games, painting on whatever I can find, and rating a new restaurant.</p>
